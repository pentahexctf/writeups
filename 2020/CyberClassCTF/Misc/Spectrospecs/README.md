# CyberClassCTF - Spectrospecs

* **Category:** Misc
* **Points:** 150

## Challenge

> Luna Lovegood says that using her Spectrospecs, she can see the wrackspurts in your head, and advises that you get rid of them immediately by listening to [one hour of bonk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nQ6JapKK1mQ). You ask to borrow her spectrospecs in an attempt to see the hidden wrackspurts. Luna glady complies and after some examination you conclude that you should listen to this short clip of audio instead. Find the flag?

## Solution

Unfortunately, we can't just open the file with a hex editor again.

Or can we...

Nah, we can't.

Use your favorite audio editing tool to look at the spectrogram.
