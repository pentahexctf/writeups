## Challenge

> Someone sent a message in the format CCTF{XXXXX-XXXX-XXX}. Could you help me decrypt it?

(message.wav was attached)

## Solution

Upon listening to the file, we hear beeps.

This is either some stupid obscure satellite transmission protocol, or we found an easy morse challenge.

Guess which one it was.
