# CyberClassCTF - moreRSA

## Challenge

> Last time the modulus was too small. We made it bigger this time. Hopefully its a bit more secure.

(moreRSA.txt was attached)

## Solution

It's basically the same as last time, but with a bunch of small primes.

This is multiprime RSA. I'm sure there's an intelligent way to solve it.

I am not intelligent.

Instead of p and q, I had half the friggin alphabet. It worked in the end, so no complaints.
