## Challenge

> I really like my work, I get to make cool cryptography CTF challenges but with Rubik's cubes! Sadly, they aren't good enough to get released, but hey, I took a nice image of my work! You should go try to find some more about my work :)

Comment                         : A long day of doing cube crypto at work... but working at Groobi Doobie Shoobie Corp is super fun!
```

Googling "Groobi Doobie Shoobie Corp" gives us a Twitter account. We find a bunch of tweets (including a retweet of Elon-chan, nice). The oldest tweet on the account says:

```
Woah, now this is kinda cool! I really like not having to use that wacky Instagram site anymore. (Feel free to follow me @groovyshoobie tho)
It's kinda cool here! I think I'll stay here. 
Gotta go water the houseplants now though :)
```

Navigating to groovyshoobie on Instagram, we find the flag in the profile (bio? i don't use social media what is this called)
