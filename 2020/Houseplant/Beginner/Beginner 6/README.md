## Solution

I'm going to do an actually honest writeup (with no sarcasm this time) because I'm bored and writeups are boring.

We immediately notice that all the numbers are within the range 9-26. 26 is coincidentally the number of letters in the alphabet. Our immediate thought is A1Z26, also known as "letter numbers".
