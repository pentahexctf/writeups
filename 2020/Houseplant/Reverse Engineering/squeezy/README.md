## Solution

`main()` is called at runtime. `main()` in turn calls `checkpass()`. `checkpass()` takes user input, then calls `whoah(key,userinput)`. It then base64 encodes the valued returned, comparing it to `HxEMBxUAURg6I0QILT4UVRolMQFRHzokRBcmAygNXhkqWBw=`.

A quick inspection indicates that `whoah(s1,s2)` is a simple XOR implementation. Since we have the key and the base64 encoded ciphertext, we can easily reverse the plaintext.

A Python implementation is possible, but I just used CyberChef.
