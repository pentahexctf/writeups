## Solution

Adventure-Revisited was a pwn challenge in this CTF, but I thought it was more of a misc challenge.

You're directed to #adventure-revisited on the CTF discord, and going there shows me a Discord bot. To solve the challenge, you need to pwn the bot to give you a flag.

Checking the chat, some people ran the command `jst eval` on the bot, but it errored out and said that you could not eval in this guild.

So, I invited the bot onto a private test Discord server, and tried out `jst eval` again.

`jst eval` runs Python code! I immediately tried to get some sort of a shell, but unfortunately, import, exec, eval, and even the double-underscore tricks are not allowed. Next, I hoped to try and see if the flag was stored in a global variable, so I ran `jst eval return globals()`, which returned this.

The return value has a limited size, so the massive amount of random garbage in `globals()` hides any important data. However, using some Python list comprehension, we can filter all of the `[HIDDEN]`s out.

This just leaves us with one value, `cuyf`, which has a blank flag. Huh. After like 30 more minutes of debugging and trying random things, I eventually did `jst eval return cuyf` and got the flag.
