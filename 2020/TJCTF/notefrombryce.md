# TJCTF 2020

TJCTF 2020 was a CTF run by TJHSST's Computer Security Club. I played with the team `inSmartCard`, finishing 14th (in the high school teams, 20th with observer teams). Check out my team page on the CTF website [here](https://tjctf.org/teams/profile/924) to see me carry my team :^). Here are some writeups of some challenges which I thought were interesting.

## Web

My specialty in CTFs are web challs, which is I tried to solve every web challenge in this CTF.



## Additional note from Drakon:
I kind of just directly ported these writeups (with minor modifications), so the format isn't really what we normally use. Sorry for any inconsistencies.
